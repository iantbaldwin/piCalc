piCalc was built with the Raspberry Pi in mind.

Calculates Pi to as many decimal places as defined in the script. I have included a sample calculation out to 10,000 decimals, I will soon add one for 1,000,000 decimals as soon as the RasPi does its magic. 

For calculations, I used the Gauss-Legendre Algorithm to estimate Pi, I used the process found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussâ€“Legendre_algorithm

All values and formulas were taken from this page and modified for use with Python. 

I did not use any of the calculus, while fairly basic the resulting equations led to more simple code.
